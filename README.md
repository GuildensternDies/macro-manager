# Working title: Macro Manager

## API: Edamam

## Site link: https://macromanager.surge.sh

Features: A form that accepts inputs of macronutrients and the desired intakes per day, and stores them in a list. A second form that accepts food they eat, and how many servings. A function that pulls nutrition data about that food from the edamam api, and checks how much of each input macronutrient is contained in the input food list. It then returns a list of the macronutrients contained in all the food they've entered, and updates their goal list with how close they are to reaching them.

Stretch goals: Create local storage for all data so inputs are held onto after closing or refreshing the browser. I attempted and failed to create a steam animation rising from the plate. Instead, I added small icons of a burger and a head of lettuce that appear when you hover over the nav links, and added a function that turns the text in the goal section green when you meet your goal, and red when you exceed double your goal.
