# Working title: Macro Manager

## API: Edamam

Features: A form that accepts inputs of macronutrients and the desired intakes per day, and stores them in a list. A second form that accepts food they eat, and how many servings. A function that pulls nutrition data about that food from the edamam api, and checks how much of each input macronutrient is contained in the input food list. It then returns a list of the macronutrients contained in all the food they've entered, and updates their goal list with how close they are to reaching them.

Stretch goals: Create local storage for all data so inputs are held onto after closing or refreshing the browser. Create CSS animation of steam rising from title plate.
