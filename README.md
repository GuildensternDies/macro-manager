# Working title: Macro Manager

## API: Edamam

Features: A form that accepts inputs of macronutrients and the desired intakes per day, and stores them in a list. A second form that accepts food they eat, and how many servings, and stores that in a second list. A function that pulls nutrition data from the edamam api, checks how much of each input macronutrient is contained in the input food list, and returns a completion percentage of their goals.

Stretch goals: an additional button that can be pressed when entering a food item to display a full nutrional facts image for that item before they enter it into the list. If all that is complete, use the recipe puppy API to create a recipe suggestion box with recipes containing food items entered.
